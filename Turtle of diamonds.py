# Let's draw the Two of Diamonds playing card, like this:

  
# 1.
# Set the pencolor to 'red' and the pensize to 5.

# 2.
# Get into position to draw the first diamond by turning 45 degrees left.

# 3.
# Draw the first diamond! Move 30 steps, then turn 90 degrees left.

# Move forward three more times to complete the diamond. Make sure to turn between each side!

# 4.
# Get into place for the second diamond. Lift the pen, then turn right 45 degrees.

# Click run and make sure the turtle is facing straight down.

# Move forward 40 steps, then turn 45 degrees right again. Don't forget to put the pen back down!

# 5.
# Draw the second diamond to match the first.

# 6.
# Run your code, check if it looks right, then mark it!
