# Let's draw a triangle!

# We've given you the sizes for the side length and the angle, and have started the triangle. You need to complete it!

# It should look like this:

  
# 1.
# Click run to see what the program draws so far.

# The turtle moves forward the number of steps stored in side, then turns left using angle for the degrees.

# 2.
# Move forward again to draw the next side. Use the variable side for the number of steps.

# Then turn left again, using the angle variable.

# 3.
# Keep going! The rest of the code is up to you.

# Run your code often to see if the turtle is on track.

# 4.
# Don't forget to mark your program!



from turtle import *

side = 100
angle = 360 / 3

forward(side)
left(angle)
forward(side)
left (120)
forward (side)


# Add code above this line to finish the triangle!
