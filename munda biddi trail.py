# You're cycling the Munda Biddi Trail.

# Let's work out how far you still need to go! We'll use these numbers:

# The trail is 1000 kilometres long;
# You cycle 70 kilometres a day;
# You have been cycling for 5 days so far.
# We've started the program for you.

# 1.
# The days variable is set to 0. It needs the correct value. Type in how many days you've been cycling so far.

# 2.
# Set the km_left variable to calculate:

# total kilometres − (kilometres per day × days)

# 3.
# The print statement prints the km_left variable. Click run to see if it prints the correct answer:

# 650
# 4.
# Don't forget to mark your program!




total_km = 1000
km_per_day = 70
days = 0
km_left = total_km - (km_per_day )
